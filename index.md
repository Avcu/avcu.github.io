title: "About Me"
---

I am a Software Engineer based in Seattle. Outside work, I like to run, bike and
hike. You can find some of the routes that I have run and biked in several
cities [here][routes].

I finished my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern
California(USC). I started at USC as a PhD student in Electrical and Electronics
Engineering and worked in a brain computer interface(BCI) laboratory as a
research assistant. I was working at the intersection of statistical signal
processing and control theory, trying to develop models for large-scale brain
networks during direct electrical stimulation. These models are ultimately
designed to be used for control purposes in closed-loop BCI applications.

Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at
Bilkent University in 2019. I spent a summer as a Data Science Intern in Agency
for Science, Technology and Research ([A*STAR][A_STAR]) in Singapore. I studied
on the detection of epileptic seizures based on EEG data by using both
traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and developed
[SeizNet][SeizNet].
