title: "About Me"
---

I am MSc student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. During my masters, I worked in the [Neural Systems Engineering & Information Processing Lab][NSEIP] as a research assistant. 
My research interest lies at the intersection of statistical signal processing and control theory.

I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University in 2019. I spent a summer as a Data Science Intern in Agency for Science and Technology ([A*STAR][A_STAR]), Singapore 
where I studied on the detection of epileptic seizures based on EEG data by using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and developed [SeizNet][SeizNet].
