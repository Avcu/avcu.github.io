        <h3>I love running and biking, and here you can find the routes that I have run
          and biked throughout Los Angeles together with the links to the tools used to prepare this page.
          While I was studying at USC, I got more into both running and biking mainly
          because of COVID confining us in our small places that we could barely afford.
          So, I spent more and more time doing both while enjoying the beautiful weather in the Southern California.

        <h3> <i>Technical details:</i> Preparing this website is two folds. First, I wrote a
          <a href="https://github.com/Avcu/GPX-data-pipeline">Python script</a>
          that processes given GPX (this is how fitness/tracking apps store your geospatial data) files, and
          creates a KML file with all the tracks and a JSON file to store some statistics. Then, the KML file is
          provided to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview">Maps Javascript API</a>,
          while we load the JSON file to display the statistics. Feel free to contact me for any suggestions and/or questions.
