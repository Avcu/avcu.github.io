        <h3>I love running and biking. Here, I visualized the routes that I have run
          and biked in several cities. You can also find some links to the tools that I used to prepare this page.
          In the beginning of 2020, I got more into running and biking mainly because of COVID confining us in small places that
          I could barely afford with my PhD stipend. So, I spent more and more time doing both.

        <h3> <i>Technical details:</i> Preparing this website is two steps. First, I wrote a
          <a href="https://github.com/Avcu/GPX-data-pipeline">Python script</a>
          that processes given GPX (this is how fitness/tracking apps store your geospatial data) files, and
          creates a KML file with all the tracks and a JSON file to store some statistics. Then, the KML file is
          provided to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview">Maps Javascript API</a>,
          while we load the JSON file to display the statistics. Feel free to contact me for any suggestions and/or questions.
